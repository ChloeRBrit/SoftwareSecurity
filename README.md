# SoftwareSecurity
Artemis Financial was the client, seeking assistance in enhancing the security of their software application. Their primary concern was to address security vulnerabilities in their codebase, specifically related to encryption, secure communication, and overall software security.

During the assessment, I effectively identified vulnerabilities such as insecure encryption practices, lack of secure communication protocols, and potential injection attacks. Addressing these vulnerabilities was crucial to prevent data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential financial losses for Artemis Financial.

Coding securely is essential because it protects sensitive data, preserves the integrity of systems, and maintains user trust. By implementing industry-standard security practices, Artemis Financial can safeguard their customers' financial information and maintain regulatory compliance, thereby enhancing their reputation and avoiding legal penalties.

The vulnerability assessment process provided valuable insights into the security posture of the software application. However, determining the most effective mitigation techniques and prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation was challenging. In the future, I would leverage threat modeling techniques and risk assessments to prioritize vulnerabilities based on potential impact and likelihood.

To increase layers of security, I implemented measures such as deploying AES encryption, transitioning to HTTPS for secure communication, and conducting static testing using OWASP Dependency-Check Maven. These enhancements bolstered the application's resilience against various attack vectors and reduced the risk of data breaches.

To ensure both functionality and security post-refactoring, I conducted thorough testing, including functional testing and dependency checks. Regular code reviews, automated testing, and continuous monitoring are essential practices to detect and mitigate new vulnerabilities introduced during code changes.

Throughout the assignment, I utilized tools such as Java Keytool, OWASP Dependency-Check Maven, and Eclipse IDE for certificate generation, vulnerability assessment, and code refactoring. Adopting these tools and adhering to secure coding practices will be beneficial in future assignments and tasks involving software security.

For future employers, I would showcase artifacts such as the practices for secure software report, screenshots demonstrating secure communication, and code snippets highlighting secure coding practices. These examples demonstrate my ability to assess, mitigate, and communicate about software security risks effectively.
